# DRAFT

## Preface

So, when I bought my place, the previous owner had already converted the coat closet into a pantry.
They removed the rod, and added some cheap shelves. 
The old wire shelves have supports at 45 degrees that get in the way of the contents on the shelf below. 
So we wanted to replace them with wooden shelves. 

We decided to add shelves that were both multiple lengths and can be moved to adjust for future needs. 
So, we decided to mimic how the kitchen cabinets work by using shelf pins. 

## Before

The pictures here show how out pantry looked before. 
As you can see, we need more shelves, and would like to get the food off of the floor.
