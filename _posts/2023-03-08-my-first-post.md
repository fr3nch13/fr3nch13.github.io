This is my first post.

I recently dove into Github Pages and I'm in the process of learning how to use it.
This is also my first time playing with Jekyll, and the templating/themes. I chose to go with the [Minimal Mistakes Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) as it was free, I liked his design, and I like how extendable/customizable it is.
